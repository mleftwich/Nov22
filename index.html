                My Love,<br /><br />
                There literally are no words. I could never have imagined what was in store for me, that night you took a risk and drove out to some strange dude's house in the bush; can't say I condone that behaviour, but I'm forever grateful you did :P
                <br /><br />
                Since that night, my love and appreciation of you has grown exponentionally - everyday you do something that makes me feel like I won the lottery, and also leaves me filled with fear and gratitude - fear that I was almost too stubborn to let you in, and gratitude that you knew what you wanted. Your determination is why I now get to walk through life with you.
                <br /><br />
                You saw through the barriers I'd put in place and past the broken facade of the man I was pretending to be; full of faults and misguided pretense, to who I really am and what I was supposed to be. Your love has been my rock and I can't ever express how thankful I am for your resilience and patience. 
                <br /><br />
                I could never have dreamed all those years ago(that sometimes only feels like yesterday) where we would be today - we have a house babe! Wtf. I know it's been stressful but I can't wait to build our foundation, our little launching pad for life. We are gonna do amazing things, and I'm so blessed to be along for the ride.
                <br /><br />
                I have tried so hard to get all this ready for you in time so I really hope it pans out, but if it doesn't I hope you don't feel too rejected by the time you get here! If you haven't seen it on the actual day I promise it was hard for me to not cave and show you, but I wanted it to be a whole thing.
                <br /><br />
                You are my absolute favourite, I love you with all my heart and I can't wait to see what the next chapter holds in store for us.
                <br /><br />
                Happy anniversary sweetheart, all my love.
                <br /><br />
                -Matt.
